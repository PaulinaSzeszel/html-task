        The Godfather is a 1972 American epic crime film[2] directed by Francis
        Ford Coppola, who co-wrote the screenplay with Mario Puzo, based on
        Puzo's best-selling 1969 novel of the same title. The film stars Marlon
        Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall,
        Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte, and Diane Keaton. It is the
        first installment in The Godfather trilogy, chronicling the Corleone
        family under patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando) from 1945 to 1955. It
        focuses on the transformation of his youngest son, Michael Corleone
        (Pacino), from reluctant family outsider to ruthless mafia boss.
        Paramount Pictures obtained the rights to the novel for $80,000, before
        it gained popularity.[3][4] Studio executives had trouble finding a
        director; the first few candidates turned down the position before
        Coppola signed on to direct the film but disagreement followed over
        casting several characters, in particular, Vito (Marlon Brando) and
        Michael (Al Pacino). Filming took place primarily on location around New
        York City and in Sicily, and was completed ahead of schedule. The
        musical score was composed principally by Nino Rota, with additional
        pieces by Carmine Coppola.
