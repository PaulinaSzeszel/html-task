        The Shawshank Redemption is a film about life in the American Shawshank
        prison, where corruption among guards and management plays a major role.
        Andy Dufresne, a banker, is sentenced to life in prison for the murder
        of his wife and her lover. However, he continues to insist that he is
        innocent. In Shawshank, after a rocky start, he becomes familiar with
        his fellow inmates. One of them is Red, the narrator of the story, who
        is charmed by Andy's sheer cleverness. When Andy asks Red if he can get
        a geologist's hammer, Red, who has mates at the laundry, delivers this
        hammer to Andy. The contact blossoms into a friendship. One day, Andy,
        Red and other buddies get a chance to re-tar the prison roof. During
        this odd job, Andy overhears the head guard Byron Hadley talking about a
        possible inheritance, of which he is in danger of missing out on a large
        part due to the American inheritance tax. Andy, a former banker with a
        knack for financial matters, proposes to Hadley that he donate part of
        his fortune to his wife to evade the estate tax. Hadley doesn't believe
        Andy at first, but takes Andy's advice anyway. And so it happens to
        Andy, Red and their friends that they get to drink a beer on a warm May
        day.
